High resolution PNG of the UC San Diego Library's Data & GIS Lab sticker "dont_put_spaces_in_file_names", if you wish to have your own printed. (Ours were printed as 2.5x3 from [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/).)

Sticker background is UC San Diego campus snippet of the [US Building Footprints dataset](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints).

There is also a template .psd file that has just the folded paper icon outline and the text. Feel free to adapt this text as you wish ("dont_put_spaces_in_column_headers" or whatever your naming pet peeve may be).
